# Designated-Adult
An overly complex grocery and chore list generator.


## Theory:  
Being an adult is hard, you have to decide what's for dinner and keep the house in order.  
This should make that easier by telling you what to cook and when you need to wash your clothes.  
A good way to view it is as a preventative maintenance scheduler for life.

## Plan:  
Build a system for creating a working inventory of your household based on Consumables vs Durable and expected lifespans  
Using the working inventory, track usage and shelf life  
Based off of depletion from usage and product life, generate grocery lists - This is MVP  

### Add in recipe system  
Standard format for recipe ingredient lists, prep times, wait times, and cook times  
Can scan working inventory of house and suggest recipes  
Also able to expand working inventory for queued recipes  
Keeps estimates of nutritional values if possible  
Works to suggest meals that work together to maintain a balanced diet, and allows ranking  
Able to submit and scan external recipe databases to help expand food horizons or something  

### Add in chores  
Look, we gotta do chores, but now this is turning into a proper scheduler rather than a list generator  
Same concept of frequency determinations  
Easy interface to defer chores or accomplish ahead of time  
Can expand to longer period tasks like taxes and bills

### Single Tasks  
Distinction between important and casual  
Works to help you break down the tasks and tracks progress

Congrats, you now have a designated adult to direct your life so you don't have to think about it anymore! What's for dinner? I don't know. The computer will tell me! Yay!
